My first stream and (documented) attempt at re-creating websites ever! Thank you to all those who watched :)

Website suggested by [Jamsheed Mistri](https://jmistri.com)

**Wins**
- Correctly guessed the typeface: Verdana

**Lessons**
- **Pay attention to block vs inline-block/inline elements**
- Macs have a built-in color picker
- I was going to make a triangle in CSS but then Jamsheed sent the triangle symbol in the stream chat â–² ðŸ™ƒ
- The navigation can be visually replicated with just a string in a `p` element

## Worked on the site for ~30 minutes before first preview, with some hints/tips from stream viewers
